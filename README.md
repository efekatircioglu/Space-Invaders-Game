Overview
This is a personal project inspired by the classic arcade game Space Invaders. 
The game is simple but challenging: you try to stay alive by killing enemies while staying away from them.

The game offers:
3 difficulty levels that adjust enemy speed.
3 unique power-ups to aid in defeating enemies: freezing enemies, faster bullets, and slowed enemies.
Your goal is to score as much as possible!

Features
Increasing Difficulty: Enemy speed increases the longer you survive.
Power-ups:
Freeze Power-Up: Temporarily stops all enemies.
Faster Bullets Power-Up: Increases your firing rate.
Slowdown Power-Up: Slows down enemies, making them easier to hit.
